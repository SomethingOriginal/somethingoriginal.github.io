        <td style="text-align: center">The HD-DVD is the most recent obsolete format on my site. It died from being wrong as well as not having enough support. It was originally released in 2006 but was discontinued merely 2 years later in 2008. Its overall specs were worse than Blu-Ray and it just didn't have enough support from the industry to become the HD disc compared to Blu-Ray. Companies enjoyed the DRM on Blu-Rays, and retailers decided to carry Blu-Rays instead of HDDVDs. ANother important factor is the PS3 which brought Blu-Ray players to the world.</td>

<p class="ggborder">I have never held a HD-DVD in my hand. Despite being the most recent, it has been forgotten and left behind compared to the other formats I covered. And compared to LaserDiscs or floppy disks, I have really no interest in this at all. Blu-Rays have definitivly won so hard, that there really are not benefits to the HD-DVD when comparing to prior wars. </p>
