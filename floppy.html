        <td style="text-align: center"> The 5 1/4 is when floppies really hit it off. It was less expensive than 8 inchers so they could be mass produced in greater quantities. It laucnhed in 1976 and quickly became popular. However, as file sizes grew and Operation Systems started to go on hard drives, the floppy had to become bigger. </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">Now this was <strong>THE</strong>floppy disk. It's the save icon, icon of physical storage in the  90s and late 80s even. It has higher storage, smaller size, and better design to prevent environmental damage to it. It marched onward thanks to inertia and sheer usability compared to newer formats. CDs wouldn't really be viable until they became rewritable. As USB drives got better out of nowhere, the floppy died slowly.</td>

<p class="ggborder">Now, my experiences with floppy disks are extremely limited. My dad had some floppies around but I ruined them when I was younger and unknowing of their relative rarity. It is through LGR, Foone, and other older tech YouTubers and people that I realize how prevalent floppy disks were, espcially since it's difficult to find some today. Heck, I got excited when I saw a Zip-Drive in person in the dark corners of a forgotten cabinet at high school.</p>
